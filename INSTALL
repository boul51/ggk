In order to build this library, you need to:

1. Call the environment setup script for your target (optional, not needed on desktop)
e.g.:
. /opt/poky/2.0.1/environment-setup-cortexa9hf-vfp-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi

2. Generate the configure script
autoreconf --install
(You may need to install autoconf, automake and additional packages for that)

3. Launch configure
For desktop:
./configure
(configure script may ask you to install some additional packages, go ahead)

For target;
./configure --host=arm-linux

4. Launch make
make
(The libraries are generated in src/.libs)

5. Install the package (optional, desktop only: should not be used on target where the lib should be installed in your SDK)
sudo make install
